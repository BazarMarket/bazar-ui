                        <p>We collect your data when you register to Depop and when you are using our Service. We use
                            your data so that you can use the Service and, from time to time, we may use your data to
                            comply with our legal obligations or for other legitimate reasons. There may also be times
                            when we ask for your consent to use your data.</p>
                        <p>We collect data from you when you use our Service or when you provide it to us, for example
                            when you:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Register to use the Service.</li>

                            <li>Make an offer or buy an item.</li>
                            <li>View, like, save, search for or comment on an item, add an item to your bag or
                                communicate with other users.</li>
                            <li>Sign up to our marketing emails and push notifications.</li>

                        <p>We need a legal reason to collect and use your data. The main reason we use your data is to

                        <p>We may also collect and use your data if we:</p>

                            <li>Have a legitimate reason to do so in a way which might reasonably be expected as part of
                                running our business (known as a legitimate interest), as long as your interests and
                                fundamental rights do not take priority over our legitimate reasons.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>We have listed below more information on the types of data we collect and why we use it.</p>

                        <p>If you connect your Depop account to another account, such as a Google or Apple, we will
                            collect data in accordance with the privacy settings you have on that social network.</p>
                        <p>The data we may receive includes your name, ID or handle, profile picture, gender, username,
                            user ID, age or age range, language, country, friends list, follower list and any other
                            information you agree to share.</p>
                        <p>We use this data to help create your public profile on our Service, and help you share your
                            experiences on our Service with your friends, followers or contacts on the social network
                            you have connected your Depop account to.</p>
                        <p>If you agree, we may also use your data to give you updates on the social network which might
                            be of interest to you or any promotion you are taking part in. We won’t post to your social
                            network or friends, followers or contacts without your permission.</p>

                        <h3>Your relationship with other users</h3>
                        <p>We collect data about the users you follow (and users who follow you) on our Service. We use
                            this to display items to you in your search results, recommendations or feed which may be of
                            interest to you. We use technology (an algorithm) to help us do this.</p>
                        <p>If an account has been blocked or banned, we also store this data. We do this for our
                            legitimate interests of enforcing our Terms of Service and allowing users to manage who can
                            communicate with them on our Service.</p>

                        <h3>Website and app login</h3>
                        <p>When you create an account and log in, we collect your username, password and information
                            about your device. It is in our legitimate interest to use this data to keep your account
                            secure.</p>
                        <p>If you decide to log-in using a third party log-in method, we are not given your password or
                            other account login details for those social networks or other third party services.
                            However, we may receive some information from those third party services depending on the
                            third party account you choose to use to log in. For example, depending upon the third party
                            service you choose to use and your settings on that service, we may receive your email
                            address registered with that third party service.</p>
                        <p>You should keep your username and password safe and not share them with anyone else. You are
                            responsible for actions that are taken using your username and password. If you think
                            someone has access to your password or account, you should tell us immediately and change
                            your password.</p>
                        <p>You can add an extra level of security to your account by turning on two-factor
                            authentication.</p>
